00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:08.570
Eric Nixon: Here is our report of the results of your Airbnb

2
00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:10.340
Eric Nixon: investment analysis.

3
00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.190
Eric Nixon: So we'll be going over the Intro.

4
00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:28.579
Eric Nixon: the data and how the numbers add up, really excited to show our interactive dashboard with what of scenarios, and then we will come to a conclusion with actual result and

5
00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:29.850
Eric Nixon: the next steps.

6
00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:36.270
Eric Nixon: So I'll be going over the goals context we're working in. And the most important factors

7
00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:39.609
Eric Nixon: we already know that

8
00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:48.069
Eric Nixon: to have a vacation getaway for 4 weeks. That leaves us with 336 days available for for rental income.

9
00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:53.999
Eric Nixon: And we're working within your goals regarding location being close to your city of Resident Tampa Bay.

10
00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:02.880
Eric Nixon: The location, we decided is Fort Lauderdale, and you can see the neighborhoods we have highlighted

11
00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:10.680
Eric Nixon: are the ones we think are particularly suitable for this, which are Fort Lauderdale, Lauderdale at Sea and Oakland Park.

12
00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:19.629
Eric Nixon: Kpis are going to be the price per day. The price of the Airbnb rental and the occupancy rate.

13
00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:33.029
Eric Nixon: The most important question is, what price per day we would need to set to break. Even we know that the revenue is going to be the price of the R. And B times the occupancy rate.

14
00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:45.690
Eric Nixon: So the revenue minus the mortgage payments or expenses has to be greater or equal to 0. Another important question is, what other set of conditions will lead to a higher chance of bookings and or higher revenue.

15
00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:55.189
Eric Nixon: We are working with the hypothesis to use average price per day as a price. That's that.

16
00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:00.370
Eric Nixon: because a measure of central tendency is what most people have been doing with their business. It's more tribe and true.

17
00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:07.930
Eric Nixon: So we're going to show our different variables effect price per day with a fixed house condo price

18
00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:22.379
Eric Nixon: determine the price to set based off these calculation, and then we will present nice Hop House options. Which is the fun part once we get there. That, you can decide upon that are all within these goal parameters.

19
00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:28.550
Eric Nixon: And now Colton will take it away with the data and the interactive dashboard.

20
00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:30.580
Colton Balvanz: Thank you, Eric.

21
00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:41.609
Colton Balvanz: So we took a few liberties with assuming some things, we decided that within your range a $400,000 home with a 10% down payment was pretty reasonable.

22
00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:55.440
Colton Balvanz: We figured in some interest, some insurance and tax and stuff like that. And the highlight here is that your yearly payments are just over 36,000. With that we're gonna show you guys the dashboard that we created for, you know.

23
00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:00.279
Colton Balvanz: So here we can see that our

24
00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:05.880
Colton Balvanz: dashboard is based on 2 bedroom homes, condos etc., from the 3 neighborhood

25
00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:07.690
Colton Balvanz: that we picked for you guys.

26
00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:13.700
If you can accommodate between 4 and 6 people, you can see that's kind of a sweet spot for price

27
00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:23.129
Colton Balvanz: for for the 2 bedroom homes. So if you were to get a couple extra beds or something like a pullout couch. We think it'd be it could be a real benefit for you ladies.

28
00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:31.260
Colton Balvanz: and additionally, down here in the bottom, right? We show you what your break-even price is for a given occupancy rates that you can adjust your prices accordingly.

29
00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:35.129
Eric Nixon: So I'm curious. Would I be able to get

30
00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:37.420
Eric Nixon: different? Perhaps

31
00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:40.020
Eric Nixon: hire accommodates, or

32
00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:52.210
Eric Nixon: Beth, if I were to adjust the average price for any of the grap alright, I mean the the neighborhood. Could you? Actually, you know, like hone in on certain neighborhoods.

33
00:03:52.770 --> 00:04:03.740
Colton Balvanz: Sure. So if we look at Oakland Park, which is what a couple of our recommendations are, you can see that the data here does change, and your suite spots actually at 4. And you can see that reflected in the beds as well.

34
00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:12.189
Colton Balvanz: But one thing to keep in mind is that Oakland Park by itself doesn't have nearly as many data points. So really, you should kind of look at both to make your decision.

35
00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:22.950
Camille Robinson: That's really cool, Colton. I also have a question. Is there a way for us to know the break, even price? If our occupancy rate was higher or lower.

36
00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:33.439
Colton Balvanz: Sure. So over here, we've created an interactive portion of this Slider so that you can determine. Oh, if you're having a really good year, your occupancy rate is 75%.

37
00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:35.729
Colton Balvanz: You can see your break. Even price goes down.

38
00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:52.419
Colton Balvanz: But if it's a if it's a slow year, say, it's your occupancy is 50. You see, your break. Even price goes up, and we found that the point where the break, even price is closest to the average price is rather an occupancy rate of 55%. So we think that should be your goal.

39
00:04:53.180 --> 00:05:00.829
Colton Balvanz: With that we'll go back to the presentation. and I will hand it off to Camille for conclusions.

40
00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:13.579
Camille Robinson: Awesome. Thank you so much, Colton, and thank you for answering those questions right? And I'm going to go over a little bit of our summary to go over what we discussed some suggestions and our next steps.

41
00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:26.160
Camille Robinson: So what we found we found 2 homes that meet all of your requested requirements, and all of the most of the amenities also meet these requirements.

42
00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:41.779
Camille Robinson: We found through our data analysis, that the booking price at 195, about a night would be at the 55% occupancy rate. And this would be our break even price. And this would be based on a 400,000 home.

43
00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:48.909
Camille Robinson: We also know, based on our data that we can adjust the price according to our occupancy rate changes.

44
00:05:51.640 --> 00:06:04.070
Camille Robinson: So we have a couple options for you. We have our cool condo and our pink paradise. Both of these homes meet our requirements, and the hardest decision is for you to pick one

45
00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:14.750
Camille Robinson: alright, and going forward for our next steps, we suggest that you contact whichever property you think suits your personality the best.

46
00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:31.189
Camille Robinson: We also suggest that you contact us quarterly to review your internal and external data, since we will be able to adapt and adjust to real time data fluctuations. So any environmental changes or economic changes within Florida.

47
00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:39.390
Camille Robinson: We also suggest that you contact us. If you'd like to go further into analysis for any cleaning expenses or other kind of expenses
